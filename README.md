### âœ… `ArraysDisplay.java`
This program demonstrates multiple ways to display elements of a float array:

- **Naive method:** Access each index manually.
- **For loop:** Iterate through the array from start to end.
- **Reverse for loop:** Display array elements from last to first.
- **Enhanced for-each loop:** Clean and easy method to access each element.

### âœ… `ArraysDeclaration.java`
This program demonstrates various ways to declare and initialize integer arrays:

- **Method 1:** Declaration and initialization in two steps using `new`.
- **Method 2:** Declaration with direct element assignment using index.
- **Method 3:** Initialization using array literals (short-hand).

Each method also prints selected elements to verify initialization.
