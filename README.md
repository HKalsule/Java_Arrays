# ðŸ“š Java Array Programs

This repository contains simple and beginner-friendly Java programs that demonstrate how to **declare**, **initialize**, and **display** arrays using multiple approaches.

## ðŸ“‚ Included Java Files

### âœ… `ArraysDisplay.java`
This program demonstrates multiple ways to display elements of a float array:

- **Naive method:** Access each index manually.
- **For loop:** Iterate through the array from start to end.
- **Reverse for loop:** Display array elements from last to first.
- **Enhanced for-each loop:** Clean and easy method to access each element.

### âœ… `ArraysDeclaration.java`
This program demonstrates various ways to declare and initialize integer arrays:

- **Method 1:** Declaration and initialization in two steps using `new`.
- **Method 2:** Declaration with direct element assignment using index.
- **Method 3:** Initialization using array literals (short-hand).

Each method also prints selected elements to verify initialization.

### âœ… `MultidimensionalArray.java`
This program uses a **2D array** to represent a structure like apartment flats across two floors:

- Declares a `2 x 3` integer array.
- Assigns flat numbers manually.
- Uses nested `for` loops to iterate and print the array structure row-wise.

It serves as a clear example of how 2D arrays can be used in real-world modeling.

### âœ… `Array3D.java`
This program uses a **3D array** to simulate a more complex structure such as an apartment building with:

- **2 floors**
- **3 rows per floor**
- **2 flats per row**

The array is declared as `int[][][] flats = new int[2][3][2]`, manually filled with flat numbers, and printed using three nested loops. This helps visualize and understand how 3D arrays work in a real-world scenario.
