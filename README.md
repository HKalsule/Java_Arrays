# 📚 Java Array Programs

A collection of Java programs to understand and practice array operations — including 1D, 2D, and 3D arrays.

---

## 📁 File Overview

### ✅ ArraysDisplay.java
Demonstrates different ways to display a float array:
- Manual indexing
- Forward iteration
- Reverse iteration
- Enhanced for-each loop

---

### ✅ ArraysDeclaration.java
Covers multiple methods for declaring and initializing integer arrays:
- Using the `new` keyword
- Index-based assignment
- Array literal shorthand

---

### ✅ MultidimensionalArray.java
Represents a 2D array (like apartment floors and rooms):
- Declares a 2x3 array
- Populates with sample values
- Prints row-wise using nested loops

---

### ✅ Array3D.java
Simulates a 3D array structure:
- Models 2 floors, 3 rows per floor, 2 flats per row
- Uses nested loops to print all elements

## 🆕 More Programs (From `prac7.java`)

### ➕ SumOfArray.java
Calculates the sum of all elements in a 1D array using a loop.

---

### 🔍 SearchInArray.java
Checks if a specific number is present in the array using linear search.

---

### ➕ MatrixAddition.java
Performs element-wise addition of two 2D arrays and stores 
the result in a third matrix.

---

### 🔄 ReverseArrayWithNew.java
Reverses a 1D array by creating a new array and copying 
elements in reverse order.

---

### 🔄 ReverseArrayInPlace.java
Reverses the array **in-place**, 
without using any extra array.

---

### 📈 FindMaximumInArray.java
Finds the **maximum** value in a 1D array 
by comparing each element.

---

### 📉 FindMinimumInArray.java
Finds the **minimum** value in a 1D array 
using basic loop traversal.
